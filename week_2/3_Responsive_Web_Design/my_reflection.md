# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design enables websites to adapt to new devices and browsers by using fluid grids (proportion-based styling) and media queries to conditionally apply CSS styles depending on the width, device-to-pixel-ratio, and orientation of different browsers. This is a good practice because more and more devices and browsers are being built all the time, and websites would appear very differently from how they are intended if this is not addressed. Responsive design also addresses the fact that it would be nearly impossible to target every single device and browser's resolutions individually as in adaptive design.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
Smartphones and tablets have changed design by creating the need to make it possible to view the same website on a multitude of browsers. Because they are so small, smartphones and tablets have resulted in the need to design even simpler user experience interfaces. Also, smartphones and tablets have enabled touch-based interaction. I think new technologies will result in the need for even simpler UX designs because people will be so bombarded with different technologies that they won't want to keep learning new technologies if they are too complicated. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
Visually impaired people can use Apple's VoiceOver, a screen reader which converts what is on the screen to speech. This enables visually impaired people to hear what's under their finger. Visually impaired people are also assisted by zoom, dictation, font adjustments, and color adjustments.Braille can even be integrated with certan devices. We should design and develop for them because the internet should be available to anyone.


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
The concept of responsive web design makes sense because it allows the same webpage to be seem on a variety of browsers. Using DevTools to change the user agent makes sense since seeing what people see on different browsers and deviced would enable designers to better adapt their designs to them.  I don't quite understand how to determine what to set different media tags to yet without just arbitrarily testing different widths and pixels.
