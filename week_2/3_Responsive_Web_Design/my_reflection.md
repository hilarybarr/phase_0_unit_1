# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design enables websites to adapt to new devices and browsers by using fluid grids (proportion-based styling) and media queries to conditionally apply CSS styles depending on the width, device-to-pixel-ratio, and orientation of different browsers. This is a good practice because more and more devices and browsers are being built all the time, and websites would appear very differently from how they are intended if this is not addressed. Responsive design also addresses the fact that it would be nearly impossible to target every single device and browser's resolutions individually as in adaptive design.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?



* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
