# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
Web standards are constantly evolving sets of technical specifications of web technologies. A webpage that complies with web standards has valid HTML, CSS, and Javascript and meets accessibility and semantic guidelines.I think web standards are good because they provide guidelines for developers and make the process of writing code more efficient since you can frequently reuse code. Web standards make websites more accessible, for example by teaching web developers how to ensure their code is handicapped-friendly. Applying web standards also makes it possible for webpages to be viewed across browsers and across devices. Further, using web standards makes a webpage more visible to search engines.



* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not
Overall, organizing an HTML file in compliance with the standard structure makes sense to me because it seems logical to divide a webpage into major sections (i.e. section, aside, nav, article) so that an outline is naturally created. Doing so improves accessibility, searchability, internationalization, and interoperability. The HTML5 outline algorithm is a bit confusing though, especially when it comes to sectioning elements and sectioning roots. 


* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
I like the new HTML5 elements because they eliminate the need to create an excessive amount of divs. Sectioning content also make it easier to envision the different components of a website. 


* Why is reset.css necessary? 
Reset.css is necessary because different browsers have different default styles. Using reset.css resets the styles of elements to a baseline value that is specified by the web developer so it is possible to avoid these different default styles. Not all developers use reset.css, however, largely due to the increased file size it results in. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I have used Safari and Google Chrome and never noticed that sites looked different in different browsers before. It would make sense for browsers to have the same display standards since it would make it easier for webpages to be displayed as a web developer intends.
