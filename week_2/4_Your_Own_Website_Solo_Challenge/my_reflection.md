# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I learned that some designers don't believe in asking clients which other websies they like since it doesn't solve their own problems. I also learned that stealing from other designs is common. I learned about the concept of visual hierarchy. I learned that you shouldn't use more than two fonts or mix sans with serif fonts. I learned about the line-height property. I learned that a good rule of thumb in not squeezing elmenets is allowing am inumim of 10px padding between content boxes or elements. I also learned about A/B testing to study user experience to test different versions of a page.


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I love looking at a well designed website, but I have trouble creating them myself since I am not a visual thinker.  I had to replicate shadowing and coloring from other websites since i Couldn't envision any on my own.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
I found a website whose colorings I liked and applied the colorings throughout my page. I also was inspired by the borders on this (Accenture)and replicated it on my page. I copied some templates for shadowing and formatting from other websites that I liked. For example, I liked the hover feature of the Women in Engineering page so I applied it to the images in my photogrid and tweaked it a bit. Trying to extract code from a complex template with a bunch of Javascript was difficult and took a bunch of trial and error to make it do exactly what I wanted. I also played around with the wrappers a bit until the size of sections was what I envisioned. I kept moving different sections around until I liked the appearnace, like i Wasn't sure where to put the links relative to the image at the top and kept moving them around until I was happy.


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I'd like to add an rss of blog posts as an aside; add a contact forum; and eventually incorporate the Bootstrap framework for greater interactivity.


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I had trouble moving my images from three per line to two per line when it was resized, because I am not sure how to master the floats to do this. I cleared all floats and put them one per line but still want to figure out how to do two per line. I thought the Color Picker is a greater tool: http://colorschemedesigner.com/. I need to learn more about the Grid System which will help with design.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Had some trouble with responsive web design so did these tutorials: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/responsive-web-tutorials/. Browsing through these templates was also helpful in generating design ideas: http://www.templatemonster.com/web-templates.php
