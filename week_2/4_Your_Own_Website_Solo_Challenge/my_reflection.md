Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I learned some basic principles of design and user experience, such as the importance of the visual hierarchy and of selecting the right color scheme and typography. I learned that a good rule of thumb in preventing objects from being squeezed together is adding a minimum of 10px padding between context boxes or elements. Also, I learned about using A/B testing to test which ersions of a page are preferred. I also learned how common copying other designs is rather than designing completely from scratch, yet learned that some designers don't believe in asking clients which other websies they like since it doesn't solve their own problems. 


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I like looking at a well designed website but have trouble creating them myself since I am not a visual thinker. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the challenge of doing something that does not come naturally to me and was proud of myself for attempting to do design.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
First, I brainstormed what I wanted to have on my webpage and sketched out a wireframe. I browsed different template sites for inspiration and ended up replicating certain features that I liked. For example, I replicated some shadowing, borders, and color schemes that I found on some of the templates. Tweaking the code helped me learn how to create different effects and made my webpage much more attractive. I also played around with the wrappers until the size of sections was what I envisioned.I kept moving different sections around until I liked the layout of the page. Trying to determine where to place the links relative to the title of the page was particularly challenging.


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I'd like to add an rss of blog posts as an aside; add a contact forum; and eventually incorporate the Bootstrap framework for greater interactivity.


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I had trouble using media metatags to move my images from three per line to two per line when the page was resized because I am not sure how to get the floats to do this yet. Instead, I cleared all the floats and put one image per line but still want to figure out how to change the floats properly in the media metatags. I thought the Color Picker is a great tool: http://colorschemedesigner.com/. It also struck me as interesting that 40% will abandon a site that has a load time of more than 3 seconds. 


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
