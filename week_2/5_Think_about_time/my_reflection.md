# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
The biggest time management challenge I face is getting fixated on exploring a topic to the point that I end up getting off the schedule I've set for myself. There's always going to be so much more to learn about every topic, which makes it difficult to know when to move on to the next challenge. 


* How will you combat that? 
I will start each week by going through the requirements for every challenge. Then, I will return to each section and explore it more in depth. This way, I will complete all the work on time and also will have a better sense of how everything fits together before doing additional research.


* What techniques will you try?
Using Microsoft Onenote to arrange my notes will help me stay organized.To stay focused, I will dance, do karaoke, and make sure I am eating and sleeping enough. I will also practice meditation. It is pretty remarkable that meditation calms frontal lobe, thalamic, and parietal lobe activity and even increases gray matter in the brain, so it is definitely worth exploring. I am also interested in trying the Pomodoro technique (working for 25 minutes then taking a 5 minute break). 


* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
I will go through a minimum of one section every day, ideally two. My goal is to finish the DBC requirements by around Friday so that I will have a day or two to delve deeper into each section.
