## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't? 
The use of different elements, like paragraphs, links, images, ordered lists, unordered lists, and corresponding attributes and values makes sense to me. The relationship between HTML elements and CSS selectors makes sense as well. 

I don't understand how the box model works yet or how to control the size of spaces or width and height of divs, and will continue to explore this in the next lesson. For example, I don't yet understand why there was a larger space between my sixth heading and the link after it than between the other headings and links after them. 

The relationship between headings and hierarchy doesn't make sense to me yet. How to decide which sizes to use doesn't make sense yet either; for example, 100px and 200px sound the same to me, although I guess trial and error will help with this.



* What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is good in that it provides structure to content and makes it possible to turn text into images, links, tables, lists, etc. However, HTML can only create a static website. More complex languages like Javascript and server-side languages are needed for interactivity.



* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Learning how websites are structured was exciting! At first, some of my changes weren't showing up on my website but I realized it was because I only saved the CSS changes, not HTML changes as well. This was a good reminder of the need to save every file in a project before viewing the outcome.

The CSS for my classes and ids wasn't having an effect at first. After staring at the code for awhile, I realized that it was because I swapped the symbols needed to identify each (# for .). 

I also was unsure why multiple font names can be listed for the same selector and later read in one of the resources that this allows a computer to display the first font it recognizes.



* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Codecademy was helpful because it made it possible to immediately see the result of using different aspects of HTML and CSS.
