## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection


* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

I wanted more information on the difference between relative and absolute positioning, floats, and margins/padding/width/ height, so I consulted Codecademy and some other websites to learn more about this. This website was particularly helpful: http://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/. 

I also wanted to know if there was a way to apply a behavior to certain types of elements and learned about pseudoclasses like n-th child in the resources provided.




* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

Initially, my sidebar and footer sections were not showing up. I didn't fully understand how to use positioning at that point, so I continued to play around with them until they appeared. Learning how to control the width helped.

Also, when I decided to put three pictures in the content area, I tried placing them inside a table but wasn't able to figure out how to use positioning inside the table. Instead, I used positioning to get the images where I wanted without using a table. I will continue to play with tables until I understand them better.



* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I kept changing the pixels of the width manually until sections appeared how I wanted them to; then I learned that it is possible to use the percent of a width.

I had trouble getting my caption to position absolutely then realized I was trying to position it relative to the image, which was not its parent element. Positioning the image and caption absolutely to the div they were both inside enabled me to position them properly.



* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 

I understand the concept of using dividers to break up a page; the use of spans; and how to add padding, borders, margins, width, and height. I also feel confident that I understand the general concept of pseudo-classes fairly well, although I don't know all the variations yet. I don't feel like I've completely mastered how to control floats or positioning yet; I got my website to look how I wanted with a lot of experimentation rather than knowing beforehand how the positioning would look.


* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I enjoyed saving my work after every change and watching the website grow and improve over time. Viewing the completed work was highly satisfying! I enjoyed learning how HTML and CSS work and especially enjoyed learning about pseudoclasses because I never understood how the browser knows how to change the color of links depending on whether they have been visited or not.


* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I believe I may have defined more selectors than necessary. With more practice, I am hoping to gain a better sense of how to group elements into classes in a way that minimizes unnecessary replication. Also, writing the pseudocode seemed a bit tedious because I felt like I learned better from experimenting in HTML than organizing my thoughts in pseudocode in this case.
