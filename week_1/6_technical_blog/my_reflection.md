Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed the process of researching and writing a blog post because it put me in a mindset where I saw websites I have visited before from a new perpsective. I haven't gotten any comments or views yet but am looking forward to learning how to include a "comment" feature. I felt best about my wireframes for my favorite websites because I am happy that I learned a new skill. I feel less certain about the appearance of my blog, and am looking forward to learning more HTML so that I can improve this.
