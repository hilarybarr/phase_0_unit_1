## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

1. The Web is NOT the same as the Internet; the Web is only a small component of the Internet. 
2. To see a website, your browser sends out a request for a web page to a server, which is a computer that hosts webpages and sends the information about the web pages back to your browser.



* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

When setting up an HTML site, you must register for a domain name using a registrar like Godaddy.com and find a host server. You must then ensure that your website is registered in a Domain Name Server, which is like a phone book of all the domain names and IP addresses on the internet. 

When setting up an HTML site, you should remember that media like photos, videos, audio, lists, and buttons can be included using tags. It is also important to decide whether you are building a website (in which case HTML and CSS will likely be the only tools used) or a web application, in which case programming languages and databases will be used as well. 

You may also have to consider whether people will be viewing your HTML site on an antiquated browser, in which case you may want to consult the Javascript library Modernizr.js.

If there is another website that you would like to replicate when writing your HTML, you can look at the website's source code.



* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
Ecstatic :-D


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

At first, I was having trouble visualizing what exactly a Git repository is or where the information is stored. Creating the index.html file and then working on this reflection allowed me to figure out where Git repositories are stored and how to modify files. I also found learning about the Web, the Internet, web servers, domain names, and IP addresses interesting because they're terms that I always hear but never truly understood before.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Codecademy's descriptions of HTML and CSS are pretty helpful.
