## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I learned that design thinking is a problem-solving protocol that alows for problems to be identified and creatively explored and solved to improve the human experience. Design thinking combines analysis and synthesis and divergent and convergent thinking, and can occur in seven stages: define the problem, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn. 

I also learned that not all companies see the value in having a visual mockup (i.e. the article by Jason Fried discussed why his company goes straight from quick paper sketch to HTML and CSS).



* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

Even though it doesn't come naturally to me, I like design and user experience and enjoyed working on my plan and wireframes. Seeing a well-designed website gives me a happy feeling.



* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

I thought the quote that "design depends largely on constraints" was  interesting because I always envisioned that creativity operates best without limits. This led me to question whether this actually is the case, and I decided that it be true that some constraints may aid in the flourishing of creativity.

I also wondered if companies use all the steps recommended in user-centered design theory. This question was answered in the "Beyond Wireframing" article, which discusses how most companies don't go through each step because of time and budget constraints.



* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? 

I was a bit confused about the difference between design thinking and market research, so I read the part of MJV's book on this (http://designthinkingbook.co.uk). Design thinking is less structured and more focused on the extreme outliers and anything that might generate innovative ideas. Market research is more structured and focused on how people would behave in a future context. 


* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I learned that Wirify lets you see a wireframed version of any website.
I also learned how to use Balsamiq to make a sketch and was excited by all the functionalities. In addition, I learned that designers can use a grid system to align their design with CSS.



* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 

I understand the concept of design thinking and can see how valuable it would be in many contexts. Not being asthetically inclined, it will take more time for me to feel comfortable with wireframing, but being exposed to all the examples of wireframes was a good start. 



* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I liked the MJV infographic that gave examples of design thinking in action (i.e. how it reduced starvation in Vietnam and reduced gas emissions). I also enjoyed seeing all the wireframe examples.



* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I would have understood the concept of how to make a wireframe after wireframing one or two websites, but doing three was still good practice.
