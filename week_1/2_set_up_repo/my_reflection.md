*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub, you click + then New Repository in the top right corner. You type username.github.io where it says Repository name, replacing username with your username.Make sure "Public" is checked off. Check off the box that says "initialize this repository with a README." This will place a file called README in your repository. Click "Add a license" and change it to "MIT License." This will make your repository open source. Click on the "Create Repository" button to create your repository.

To clone the repository to your local computer, go to the GitHub app. Click on your name in the right sidebar. Search for yourusername.github.io and click the "Clone to this computer" button. This copies your repository from Github to your computer.


*Describe what open source means
Open source means that the way that a computer software was made is shared, and anyone can customize the program as they'd like. This makes it possible for more software to be created and with greater ease than if people had to create everything from scratch or pay for a copy of source code. It also enables communities like WordPress to grow rapidly and for free as a result of users' additions.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think that Open Source is great because it enables software to be improved faster and enables developers to learn from others. An Open Source license makes sense for creative projects that developers work on as a hobby or for non-profits. However, I can see why companies would not want their software to have an open source license, as it would make it possible for competitors to replicate their software quicker.  


*Assess the importance of using licenses
Licensing enables an author to grant specific permissions for others to use the work, such that others can use the work in a way that the author still receives credit. This is important because if people did not receive credit for their efforts, there would be less incentive to innovate. Consulting a license also allows people to determine who the original creator was, which would be helpful if they have a question for them.

*What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I tried using the command line to clone a repo before this challenge. It was exciting to see that it is possible to clone a repo with the GitHub app since it is simpler to visualize what is occurring this way. The hilarybarr.github.io repository did not appear on the GitHub app at first,  but it appeared several minutes later, and I believe the internet connection may have caused this. The challenge made me realize that GitHub is not as intimidating as it looks. Once I created a new repo on it, I had a much better sense of how GitHub works.  

*Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I found this resource to be helpful since it was a short, interactive tutoring on initializing and using Git.
