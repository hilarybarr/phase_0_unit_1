<h1> Why <strong> Brains</strong> Are Awesome </h1>
<div id="div1">
	<h2> Brains </h2>
   <p id="firstparagraph"> The brain is a remarkable three pound organ that controls all aspects of being human,</br> including decision-making, dreaming, feeling, language, and voluntary movement.   </p>
    <p id= "secondparagraph"> There are 100 billion neurons in the brain. They communicate with one another through electrochemical impulses. <br>The brain is connected to every part of the body through the Peripheral Nervous System. Each part of the body is represented </br> in a specific location in the somatosensory cortex. If a neuroscientist activates a spot on the somatosensory </br> cortex, you will experience a sensation in the corresponding body part. </p>

<ul> Some Random Facts About the Brain:
	<li class="firstlist"> People who've had a hemispherectomy (half their brain removed) have led normal lives. </li>
	<li class="firstlist"> When a person is in love, the reward centers of the brain are activated in the same way that they are activated in drug addicts.  </li>
	<li class="firstlist"> The brain itself can not feel pain, which allows neurosurgeons to operate on patients while they are awake. </li>
</ul>



<ol> Some of the Coolest Parts of the Brain:
	<li class="secondlist"> <strong>Cerebrum:</strong> comprising 85% of the brain, the cerebrum allows us to think and control our voluntary muscles. </li>
	<li class="secondlist"> <strong>Right Temporal Lobe:</strong> when a seizure occurs in this area, people often experience religious ecstasy. </li>
	<li class="secondlist"> <strong>Medial Prefrontal Cortex:</strong> this part of the brain is more active when being creative, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (a decision-making area) is less active, allowing us to focus on self-expression and improvization.  </li>
</ol>
